    <p style="text-align: center;" class="secondHeading" align="center"><strong>Claude Elwood
    Shannon </strong></p>
    <p class="summary" align="justify">Claude Elwood Shannon was born in Petoskey, Michigan on
    April 30, 1916. His father Claude Elwood Shannon Sr.(1862-1934) was a businessman and his
    mother Mabel Wolf Shannon (1880-1945) was for a number of years, Principal of Gaylord High
    School in Gaylord, Michigan, which Shannon attended and graduated from in 1932. </p>
    <p class="summary" align="justify">Shannon's special talents in mathematics and
    engineering were evident right from childhood. His best subjects in school were science
    and mathematics. At home, he constructed all kinds of devices, ranging from
    radio-controlled boats to telegraph systems that used barbed wire from the fence of a
    nearby pasture. </p>
    <p class="summary" align="justify">Following his sister Catherine, a mathematician,
    Shannon joined the University of Michigan in 1932 and graduated in 1936 with degrees of
    Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. In
    1936 he joined the Department of Electrical Engineering in the Massachusetts Institute of
    Technology as a research assistant. He was first involved in the operation of the Bush
    differential analyser, an extremely advanced analog calculating machine of that era, used
    for solving differential equations. A part of the analyser was a relay circuit, which
    stimulated his interest in the underlying theory. </p>
    <p class="summary" align="justify">During his undergraduate days Shannon had studied
    symbolic logic and Boolean algebra, and he now realized that he had the proper framework
    for the study of switching circuits. His paper entitled `A symbolic analysis of relay and
    switching circuits' appeared in 1938 and was </p>
    <p align="justify">later awarded the Alfred Nobel Prize of the combined engineering
    societies of the United States. This work was the foundation for a systematic theory of
    digital circuit design. </p>
    <p align="justify">In 1938 Shannon shifted from the electrical engineering department to
    the mathematics department. He spent the summer of 1939 at Cold Spring Harbour working
    under the geneticist Barbara Burks. It was here that he developed the ideas for his PhD
    thesis entitled `An algebra for theoretical genetics' under the supervision of Frank L
    Hitchcock, an algebraist. </p>
    <p align="justify">In 1940 Shannon received, both, the SM degree in Electrical Engineering
    and the Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics. After a years stint at the Institute of
    Advanced Study at Princeton in 1940-41, working with Herman Weyl, Shannon joined a team at
    Bell Laboratories working on anti-aircraft directors. During the next few years at Bell
    Labs, he was in the company of first rate mathematicians and scientists _ John Pierce, a
    pioneer in satellite communications, Harry Nyquist, the expert in signals, Hendrik Bode,
    well-known control theorist, John Bardeen, William Shockley and Walter Brattain,
    co-inventors of the transistor, and many others. It was here that he met and married Mary
    Elizabeth Moore, a numerical analyst in John Pierce's group. They had three children. </p>
    <p align="justify">Shannon's most important scientific contribution was his work on
    communication. In 1941 he began a serious study of communication problems, partly
    motivated by the demands of the war effort. This research resulted in the publication of
    the paper entitled, `A mathematical theory of </p>
    <p align="justify">communication' in 1948. This pioneering paper begins by observing that
    `the fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either
    exactly or approximately, a message selected at another point'. He defined the information
    content of a message in terms of binary digits. The results were so breathtakingly
    original, that it took some time for the mathematical and engineering community to realize
    their significance. A brand-new science had been created with the publication of that
    single paper, and the framework and terminology he established remains standard even
    today. </p>
    <p align="justify">Shannon's 1949 paper entitled `Communication theory of secrecy systems'
    was a fundamental paper in cryptography and was responsible for transforming it from an
    art to a science. </p>
    <p align="justify">During a World War II visit to the United States, Alan Turing, a
    leading British mathematician, spent a few months at Bell Labs working with Shannon. Both
    scientists were interested in the possibility of building a machine that could imitate the
    human brain. They also worked together to build an encrypted voice phone that would allow
    Roosevelt to have secure transatlantic conversations with Churchill. </p>
    <p align="justify">Shannon made interesting and innovative contributions to the area of
    artificial intelligence. He wrote a paper entitled `Programming a computer for playing
    chess' in 1950, and developed a chess playing computer. Many years later, in 1965, he met
    the world chess champion Mikhail </p>
    <p align="justify">Botvinnik (also an electrical engineer), and played a match with him,
    but lost after 42 moves. </p>
    <p align="justify">In 1956 Shannon was invited to be a visiting professor at the
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1958 he became Donnor Professor of Science, and
    Professor Emeritus in 1978. </p>
    <p align="justify">Shannon's interest did not stop with academics. He was an expert
    juggler who was often seen juggling three balls while riding an unicycle. He designed a
    machine to solve the Rubik cube, juggling machines, a mechanical mouse called Theseus that
    could navigate a maze, and a host of clever mechanical devices which he delighted in
    showing to his visitors. He was an accomplished clarinet player, and was even known to pen
    light verse. </p>
    <p align="justify">Shannon's published and unpublished documents (a hundred and twenty
    seven of them), cover an unbelievably wide spectrum of areas. Many of them have been a
    priceless source of research ideas for others. One could say that there would be no
    Internet without Shannon's information theory _ every modem, every compressed file, every
    error-correcting code owes something to Shannon. </p>
    <p align="justify">Shannon was the recipient of numerous honorary degrees and awards. He
    died on February 24, 2001 in Massachusetts after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease. </p>
