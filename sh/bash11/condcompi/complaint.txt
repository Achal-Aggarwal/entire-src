Respected sir
1. The feedback says incorrect checkout, however, runnning

svn import file:///home/aman/checkout/svn-repo-quiz1/repo shows that the checkout is successful.

2. For writing the equation, I have used math mode, just that I have written the equation in another file, eqn.tex. The output is as shown in eqn.pdf .

3. For Q6, it has been remarked that no "ref" tag has been used.
However, on line 91 of quiz1-answer.tex, I have used the ref tag.


I request you to look into the issues.

Thanks
