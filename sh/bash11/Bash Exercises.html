<h2>Bash Exercises</h2>

<p>Some of the exercises below are <span class="em">optional</span>
carrying <span class="em">house points</span>.  You need not have to
submit these as part of your mandatory exercises.  The house points
for these optional exercises are <span class="em">counted once per
house</span>, and will count against the name of the student
submitting the earliest.  Note that you have to submit all exercises
at once: so it will be better for your house if different members
submit different optional parts.</p>

<p>Of course I encourage everyone to try all the exercises at leisure,
or at least learn the solutions from colleagues, after the submission
deadline.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simple sequence of commands, simple if-then-else:
      <ol class="a">
	<li>Write a bash script to latex compile, bibtex compile, and view
	    dvi of a latex file.
	</li>
	<li>Now make the dvi viewing conditional: only if the earlier
	    compilations were successful.  <i>Hint:</i> You will have
	    to use "$?" to get the exit status of the previous command.
	</li>
	<li>smartlatex.sh: modify the above script so that:
            latex compilation is done only if the latex file or bibtex
	    file is newer than the dvi file (or dvi file does not exist).
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [1HP]:</span> Take a C program with two C files (or write a simple such
	    example).  Write a bash script to compile each file, link them
	    to form an executable, and run the executable.
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [2HP]:</span> Now modify the above script so that each step is conditional on
	    the previous step completing successfully.
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [5HP]:</span> smartcompile.sh: modify the above script so that:
            compilation is done only if the C file is newer than the
            object file (or object file does not exist), linking is
            done only if either object file is newer than the
            executable file (or executable file does not exist).
	</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Involving loops:
      <ol class="a">
        <li>lsdir.sh: list only the directories in the current directory.
	</li>
	<li>lslinks.sh: list only the soft-links in the current directory.
	</li>
	<li>lsexe.sh: list all the executable files in the current
            directory.
	</li>
	<li>lstype.sh: combine the above to have a single script which
  lists directories, links, or executables, depending on its argument:
  -dir for directories, -links for links, -exe for executables.  The
  script should take exactly one argument.
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [3HP]:</span> Modify the above lstype.sh to take one or more of the
  -dir, -links, -exe arguments.  The output should be corresponding to
  the given arguments.
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [3HP]:</span> change-extn.sh: This script should take two arguments,
  representing two file extensions.  It should move all files of the
  first extension in the current directory to the second extension.
  For instance:
	    <pre>	    ./change-extn.sh txt csv
	    </pre>
	    will change all files with extension .txt to extension
  .csv in the current directly.<br>
	    <i>Hint:</i> In my solution, I used a for loop, a sed command inside the
  for loop to change the extension, and the 'eval' command to evaluate
  a string (for convenience).
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [10HP]:</span> timekeeper.sh: It is often useful to have audio reminders
  during presentations, so that the presentation does not run
  overtime.<br>
	    This script should take as argument an even
  number of arguments.  The arguments are read in pairs, and in each
  pair, the first represents a time duration, and the second
  represents an mp3 file to be played after the expiry of that time
  duration.<br>
	    For example, the command:
	    <pre>	    ./timekeeper.sh 30 warning.mp3 5 warning.mp3 5 timeup.mp3 3 exceeded.mp3
	    </pre>
	    can be used for a 40 minute presentation.  It gives one warning 10 minutes
	    before time, another warning 5 min before time.  And it signals a time-up
	    sound when time is up, and a time-exceeded sound after an excess of 3 minutes.
	    <br><br>
	    As an exercise in exploring and understanding various bash features,
	    do the following.
	    <ul>
	      <li>Parse the arguments and store it in two arrays: one
		  of the time intervals and another of the files to be played.
	      </li>
	      <li>Make the player to be used an environment variable, which
		  if not specified defaults to the mpg123 command-line mp3 player.
	      </li>
	      <li>If the program is called without any arguments, the usage must
		  be printed, using a function called "usage"
	      </li>
	      <li>Write a function called "sleepmin" which takes one argument, the
		  number of minutes to sleep.  You'll have to use the "sleep" command
		  to sleep (in units of seconds).
	      </li>
	      <li>Try using the same loop variable (say i) within the sleepmin
		  function and outside of it in the main script.  What happens?
		  You need to use explicit declarations using the "declare"
		  statement.
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	</li>
	<li>photoresize.sh: in a directory there are a lot of jpg
            photos (from a digital camera).  The names of the photos
            are 2011-08-15-0091.jpg until 2011-08-15-0110.jpg.  There
            are thus a total of 20 photos.<br>

	    The script should scale the first 5 images to 10% of their
            original size.  Use the convert command with the "-scale"
            option, and a single for loop, and the seq command.  Each
            scaled image must be saved under the name
            2011-08-15-abcd-small.jpg where 'abcd' denotes the photo
            number from the original file name.
	</li>
	<li>Now write the above script using a while loop.
	</li>
	<li>Now change the script to scale all the images.  You may
            have to use the command printf.
	</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Involving sed, awk, pipes:
      <ol class="a">
        <li>Write a command to print the number of lines in a file,
            using "wc -l".  But the output should not include the file
            name which is printed by default by "wc -l".  Use pipes to
            achieve this.  Provide one solution without using awk, and
            one solution using awk.
	</li>
        <li>lsdir.sh: list only the directories in the current directory.
	    Since this solution is supposed to involve pipes, use a regular "ls -l"
	    followed by a grep.
	</li>
        <li>lslinks.sh: list only the soft-links in the current directory.
	    Since this solution is supposed to involve pipes, use a regular "ls -l"
	    followed by a grep.
	</li>
	<li>lsexe.sh: list only the executable files in the current
	    directory.  Since this solution is supposed to involve pipes, use
	    a regular "ls -l" followed by a grep.
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [5HP]:</span> getpid.sh: get the process id, given the process name
            without using pgrep.  Note: you should not print the PID
            of any other process you run within the script, including
            that of getpid.sh itself.
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [5HP]:</span> old-mcdonald.sh: this is a script to print the Old
            McDonald rhyme.  As stdin input, a sequence of lines, of
            animal:sound is given.  And out comes the rhyme.  For
            instance:

	    <pre>	    Input is:
	    pig:oink
	    cow:moo
	    dog:bow
	    
	    Output is:
	    Old McDonald had a farm ei-ei-o
	    On that farm he had a pig ei-ei-o
	    With a oink-oink here, oink-oink there
	    Here a oink there a oink, everywhere oink-oink

	    Old McDonald had a farm ei-ei-o
	    On that farm he had a cow ei-ei-o
	    With a moo-moo here, moo-moo there
	    Here a moo there a moo, everywhere moo-moo

	    Old McDonald had a farm ei-ei-o
	    On that farm he had a dog ei-ei-o
	    With a bow-bow here, bow-bow there
	    Here a bow there a bow, everywhere bow-bow

	    Old McDonald had a farm ei-ei-o
	    </pre>
	    You may have to use the 'cut' command, and of course a
	    loop to read through the input and print.
	</li>
	<li>Write an awk script to do the above.  Your output should
	    be the same as the last case, including spacings and the
	    last line ending the rhyme.
	</li>
	<li>In the above case, note that the script is not
	    grammatically correct: it prints "a oink-oink" instead of
	    "an oink-oink".  Pipe the output of the above script
	    through an appropriate sed command or script to print the
	    grammatically correct version.  Of course, your sed
	    command/script should work not just for the "oink" case,
	    but also for any animal sound beginning with a vowel, but
	    the sed script needs to work only for the above rhyme.
	    <pre>	    Example corrected output:
	    Old McDonald had a farm ei-ei-o
	    On that farm he had a pig ei-ei-o
	    With an oink-oink here, oink-oink there
	    Here an oink there an oink, everywhere oink-oink

	    (rest is the same as earlier)
	    </pre>
	</li>
	<li>Variable substitution:<br>
	    Suppose you want to rename all instances of a given variable abc
	    with another variable name efg (in a C file).  Write a script to do this, using
	    sed.  Its ok to replace instances where "abc" appears as a
	    substring in another variable name.  Your script should
	    take both the old and new variable names as argument.
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [5HP]:</span> search_html.sh:
	    This script should take 3 arguments: a text string to
	    search, an input HTML file, and an output HTML file.  Use
	    a sed command to highlight the given text string in HTML
	    by adding an appropriate style tag around the text string.
	    The output should be stored in the output file, and the
	    result be displayed in your browser.<br><br>
	    The highlight colour should have some default in your
	    script, but must be over-ridden by the HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR
	    environment variable when set.<br><br>
	    The browser to be used should have some default in your
	    script (e.g. firefox or google-chrome), but must be
	    over-ridden by the BROWSER environment variable when
	    set.<br><br>
	    The script must print the correct usage and exit, if
	    called with anything other than 3 arguments.<br><br>
	    Your script need not handle special characters such as "/"
	    in the text string.<br><br>
	    <i>Hint:</i> I found it useful to first construct the sed
	    command, and then use eval.  You may also use a sed script
	    file (dynamically constructed) if you wish.
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [5HP]:</span> Modify the above script so that the highlighting is done
	    only for exact word matches, assuming that the text string
	    input is a single word.  You may assume that spaces or
	    newlines separate each word from adjacent words.  State
	    any other assumption necessary.
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [10HP]:</span> The above script may not work for cases where the search
	    string involves a '/'.  Modify the script so that these
	    cases are also handled.  Do this modification for the
	    generic search, not the exact word match.  You can assume
	    that the '/' being searched is not part of any HTML tag
	    itself.<br>
	    <span style="color:red"><i>Hint:</i></span> You can first
	    pass the search string variable through a sed command.  I
	    had to use a sed script for this, without which this can
	    get messy.<br>
	    <span style="color:red"><i>Warning:</i></span> This can be
	    a tricky exercise!
	</li>
	<li>Write an awk command to count the number of lines in a
	    file.  Check your output against that produced by using
	    "wc -l".
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [5HP]:</span> move_tar.sh:
	    Usually creators of tgz (or tar.gz) files arrange it so
  that on untarring, all the files are put into a newly created
  directory.  But sometimes creators of tgz files don't do this, and
  this can sometimes be annoying, since if the user does a "tar zxvf"
  to extract, all the files are untarred into the current directory,
  which may have other files to begin with.  Now the user has trouble
  figuring out which files were there originally and which were from
  the untarred tgz file.<br>
	    Write a script and/or a command to move all the files from
  the untarred file, to a new directory.  For instance, after you run:
	    <pre>	    tar zxvf fortunes.tgz
	    </pre>
	    five files fortune1.txt, fortune2.txt, fortune3.txt,
  fortune4.txt, and fortune5.txt are created in the current directory.
  After this, the command:
	    <pre>	    ./move_tar.sh fortunes.tgz fortunes
	    </pre>
	    will move the five files into a directory called fortunes,
  which is created if not already present.
	    <i>Hint:</i> I found it useful to pipe the output of a
	    "tar tzvf" command through an appropriate awk command, and
	    then redirect the output to a temporary file.  I then used
	    a while loop whose input was redirected from the temporary
	    file (its possible to redirect the input for only a part
	    of the script; do the redirection just after the "done" of
	    the while loop).
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [7HP]:</span> ls_last_mod.sh:
	    This script is for doing things such as: "list all the
	    files/dirs in the current directory, which were modified
	    in the last 1 week".  The time-frame of last modification
	    has to be taken as two arguments: a number and a unit.
	    The unit can be "weeks", "days", "hours", "minutes", or
	    "seconds".<br>
	    <i>Hints:</i> First read the usage of the date command,
	    particularly the "+%s" option and the "-d" option.  All
	    time computations in bash are conveniently done in seconds
	    (since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).  I also found it useful
	    to list all the files and directories into a separate
	    temporary file, which I read line by line.  I processed
	    each line using several awk commands to extract fields.
	    Note that you also have to eliminate the first line
	    printed by "/bin/ls -l".  I did this using bash regular
	    expression comparison.
	</li>
	<li>Study the format of the file /etc/passwd which stores
	    information about various user accounts.  It includes
	    various dummy user accounts too: these have user ids, but
	    they are not allowed to login.  This is indicated by the
	    setting "/bin/false" for the login shell.<br>
	    Write an awk script to print the user ids (the first
	    field) of all such dummy accounts whose shell is "/bin/false".
	</li>
	<li>Now modify the above script to print the maximum uid among
	    all the users whose login shell is "/bin/false".
	</li>
	<li>Write an awk script or command so that the output has the
	    3rd and 4th columns swapped as compared to the input.
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [5HP]:</span> Write a bash script which will take 2 arguments: the
	    column numbers to be swapped in the input (stdin).  The
	    bash script should generate an appropriate awk command or
	    script to do the swapping.  If the either column number is
	    non-existent, the output should be the same as the
	    input.<br>
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [10HP]:</span> Awk is very useful for parsing log files.  The following
	    sequence of exercises will demonstrate that.  The file
	    "example-logfile.txt" is a real log file collected from
	    experiments in the course of a student's research (with
	    some minimal modifications for this exercise).  The
	    context and format of the log file are given in the first
	    several lines of the log file.
	    <ul>
	      <li>Now write an awk script to delete all the 'comment'
		  lines (beginning with a '#').
	      </li>
	      <li>Next modify the script to also delete all lines
		  which have anything other than 5 fields with
		  numbers.  That is, remove any line with 6 fields, or
		  4 fields, or any line with 5 fields of which one is
		  not a number (has non digit characters).
	      </li>
	      <li>Now further enhance the script to eliminate
		  duplicate entries (lines which have the same node-id
		  and log-id).  You may assume that the original log
		  file has only non-decreasing log-ids for each
		  node-id.
	      </li>
	      <li>Now further enhance the script to calculate the
		  duration of the time window for which log entries were
		  made at each node.  This is nothing but the
	    difference between the maximum and minimum timestamps of
	    each node-id.  You may assume that the timestamps are in
	    non-decreasing order in the log file.  The output of script should be a
		  two column output, with the first column being the
		  node-id, and the second column being the log time
		  duration.
	      </li>
	      <li>Now pipe the above two column output via an
	    appropriate sort program to sort numerically by the log
	    duration (2nd column of the output).
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
